### _Free and Open-Source Multiple Choice Exam Reader_

## Background

Commercially available OMR (optical mark recognition) exam sheets, scanners, and
processing software can cost educators and educational institutions thousands of
dollars per year. In response to this, OpenMCR has been developed as a free and
easy-to-use alternative. The tool includes a multiple choice exam sheet and
works with any scanner and printer.

This software and the
corresponding multiple choice sheet were developed as an independent study
project by Ian Sanders, a mechanical engineering student at the University of
South Florida, under the direction of Dr. Autar Kaw.

## Installation Instructions

Currently, installers are only provided for Windows. For other operating
systems, see [Running From Source](#running-from-source).

### Traditional Installation

To install the utility, simply download the latest `.exe` file from from the
[releases](https://github.com/iansan5653/open-mcr/releases) page and
install it. After installation, check your Start menu for a shortcut.

### Running Without Install

For users who cannot or do not want to install the software on their machine,
ZIP file packages are also available for each [release](https://github.com/iansan5653/open-mcr/releases). Download the file,
extract it anywhere on your machine, and run the `main.exe` file. This method
does not require administrator priveleges.

### Running From Source

Extract the file and open a terminal / command prompt in the extracted directory.
Run the command `python code/main.py`.
