# Free and Open Source Exam Bubble Sheet Reader

under the direction of Dr. Autar Kaw.

This tool is intended to be simple, fast, and extremely reliable. One can
conduct and grade an exam simply by printing and scanning the sheets with any
standard machine. The software has been tested extensively to ensure that
