# Free and Open Source Exam Bubble Sheet Reader

## Background

In response to the phenomonon that typical OMR (optical mark recognition, also
known as bubble sheets) exams sheets, scanning hardware, and processing software
can cost up to several thousand dollars per year, this software and the
corresponding bubble sheet were developed as an independent study project by Ian
Sanders, a mechanical engineering student at the University of South Florida,
under the direction of Dr. Autar Kaw.

This tool is intended to be simple, fast, and extremely reliable. One can
conduct and grade an exam simply by printing and scanning the sheets with any
standard machine. The software has been tested extensively to ensure that
software is as reliable as any other product available.
